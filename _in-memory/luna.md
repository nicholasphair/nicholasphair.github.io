We adopted Luna our sophomore year of college. It was less of us choosing Luna
and more of Luna choosing us. Well, choosing my girlfriend, Anna, really. As
the story goes Anna put her hand in Luna's crate and she, a normally bashful
cat, rubbed up against it. She was the one. Luna went by many, many names.
There was Luna, Miss Luna, Lunatic, Looney, Looney Tunes, Tooney, Tuna, Tuna
Fish, Fish, Fishy, Fish Stick, Toothless (she looked like toothless the
dragon), Big Momma, and probably many more.  

Luna was the definition of a therapy cat. She always knew when someone 
was sad and needed attention. We have so many great memories with Luna. 
There was her first (and only) time in the snow. Her love for Sheeba, 
particularly Sheeba sticks. How she would come alive at night and play 
with her favorite toys. She was quite fond of crinkle balls and an old 
yellow ball that predates her by years. In fact, it is only
with this yellow ball would we ever hear her little squeaks (she may 
have been mute). And of course, there was her patient, stalking of strings,
watching birds out the windows, basking in the sun, pawing us in bed for food, 
and being a great big sister to our other cat Millie. I could write pages
about the things we love about her. We love Luna and she is very missed.
