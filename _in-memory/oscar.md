Oscar "Mayer" was my childhood dog. He was the Goldendoodle before it was cool
to be a goldendoodle. My family has many great memories with Oscar, who was
lovingly nicknamed, "The Devil Doodle", by my uncle. I'll always remember him
sitting underneath his favorite tree as we played out back, surveying the
driveway for any UPS driver who dared come too close.  Not shockingly, while
Oscar had a big bark, it was really a facade for a bundle of fur who loved
having his paw held. Other great memories include Oscar eating my grandma's
birthday cake. Oscar hopping through snow, disappearing every time his feet hit
the ground because his white fur blended in. His insistence on tearing the
wrapping paper off of gifts for us, and his love for all food - cheese doodles
and Nilla wafers were among his favorites.  He is very loved and very missed.
