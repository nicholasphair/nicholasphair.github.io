Welcome. My name is Nick and this is my site. I am a second year PhD student in
the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I am a member
of the [LESS lab][4] advised by Professor [Kevin Sullivan][5]. Before starting
at UVA I worked as a senior software engineer at CCRi in Charlottesville, Va.
My tech interests lie all over the place. They include, though definitely are
not limited to, software design and all things programming, computer
architectures, operating systems, cyber security, hardware/electronics
tinkering, and some networking.  


I think its important to have interests all over the place. In that regard, I
enjoy all sorts of sports. Hockey, baseball, and boxing top my list. Outside of
sports I enjoy woodworking. My experience ends at making a jewelry box in my
apartment, but I am actively stalking the forums and am looking forward to the
day I can set up my own home shop. Of course, like my tech interests, this is
not an exhaustive list.  


I see this site as an opportunity to share what I know with whoever wants to
read. I am extremely passionate about teaching and love the idea of using
technology as a platform to do so. So much so that I wrote my college essay
about [khanacademy][3] founder, Sal Khan. He is a tremendous inspiration to me
and at some point I'd like to start producing videos in a similar fashion.  

Welcome, and thanks for reading!
